   The local font files are under assets/icons. If you want to totally
   remove local icons, just delete the whole folder besides removing
   this import. Their source is
   https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/tree/master/iconfont
   (when downloading from there, open each file in GitHub and click Download,
   as right clicking on the file name and selecting Download link as won't
   work as expected, producing corrupt files).
